These key features demonstrate the development of a responsive web page with a header, product cards, a scroll effect, a footer, and hosting on GitHub.

    Responsive Web Design:
    The project is built with responsive web design principles, ensuring that the website adapts to different screen sizes and devices.
    Header Section:
    The project includes a header section that contains a logo and a navigation menu.
    The header is styled with CSS to have a specific background color, font size, and alignment.
    Product Cards:|
    The main section of the website consists of multiple product cards.
    Each product card has a defined structure using HTML elements.
    CSS styles are applied to the product cards, including width, margin, padding, and background color.
    Product Card Styling:
    Use various CSS properties to style the product cards.
    The product title and description are styled with specific font sizes, colors, and margins.
    The product action section, which may contain buttons or other interactive elements, is styled with proper alignment and spacing.
    Scroll Effect:
    Add a scroll effect to the product card section.
    By adding more product cards, the section becomes scrollable, allowing users to scroll through the cards.
    Footer Section:
    The project includes a footer section at the bottom of the page.
    The footer contains a "Made with ❤️" text.
    CSS is used to center the footer and provide appropriate margin and padding.
    Hosting on GitHub:
    Sign up for a GitHub account if not already done.
    The project's code files are uploaded to a new GitHub repository.
    The project is deployed using GitHub Pages, allowing the final result to be accessed through a hosted link.
